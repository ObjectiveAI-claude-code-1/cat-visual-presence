1. Evaluate the scale of the cat within the image. Determine how much of the total frame area the cat physically occupies. A cat that fills a generous share of the image — large enough to feel like the undeniable subject and anchor of the composition — should be rewarded. A cat that is tiny, distant, or occupies only a small sliver of the frame should be penalized. The cat does not need to fill every pixel, but it must feel like the reason the photograph exists rather than a minor element competing with furniture, landscape, or empty space around it.

2. Evaluate the completeness of the cat within the image. Determine whether the cat's full body is contained within the boundaries of the frame. A cat that is wholly visible — from nose to tail, with no paws sliced off by the bottom edge, no ears cropped by the top, and no parts vanishing beyond the margins — should be rewarded. A cat that overflows or is clipped by the frame edges should be penalized, because a subject that spills beyond the visible area feels interrupted and incomplete regardless of how large it appears. Completeness does not demand forensic detail of every whisker, but it does demand that the full form of the animal is present and accounted for.

3. Evaluate the intentionality of the cat's placement within the image. Determine whether the cat's size and position within the frame feel deliberate and composed rather than accidental. A cat that sits comfortably within the frame with a natural margin of surrounding space — neither crowded against an edge nor isolated in a vast ocean of empty background — should be rewarded. A cat that is awkwardly jammed to one side, or that is technically large and complete but appears to have wandered into the shot by coincidence, should be penalized. This task captures the difference between a photograph taken of a cat on purpose and one that merely happens to contain a cat.
