Evaluate the proportional presence of the cat within the image. Determine how much of the frame the cat physically occupies relative to the total image area. A cat that fills a substantial portion of the frame — large enough to feel like the undeniable reason the photo was taken — should score high (closer to 1). A cat that is tiny, distant, or reads as a minor element in a larger scene should score low (closer to 0). However, proportional presence is not purely bigger-is-better. A cat that overflows the edges of the frame and appears clipped, cropped, or fragmented should be penalized because the subject feels incomplete. The ideal high score reflects a cat that is both generously scaled and wholly contained — big enough to command attention, complete enough to be fully appreciated, and sized in a way that feels deliberate rather than accidental. Consider whether the cat's body is fully visible or partially cut off by the frame edges. A cat that is comfortably and completely present within the image while occupying a generous share of the visual space represents the pinnacle of proportional presence.
