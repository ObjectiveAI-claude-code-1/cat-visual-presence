# Cat Visual Presence

## Purpose

There is a particular kind of photograph — one where you look at it and immediately understand why it was taken. The cat is right there: large, whole, unmistakable. It is not lurking in a corner or peeking from behind furniture. It is not a smudge of fur on a distant windowsill. The cat is the photograph. That feeling — that undeniable, gravitational centrality of the subject — is what cat-visual-presence exists to measure.

This function receives a single image as its input and returns a score between zero and one. The score reflects how proportionally present the cat is within the frame. A high score means the cat dominates the visual space in a way that feels generous, complete, and purposeful. A low score means the cat is diminished — either too small to matter or too fragmented to fully appreciate.

The use-cases for such a function are broad. It can serve as a quality signal for curating photo collections, filtering uploads to platforms that celebrate cats as subjects rather than as incidental background elements. It can guide automated cropping tools, helping them understand when a frame has achieved the right balance between subject and space. It can act as one component in a larger evaluation pipeline — one voice among many that together describe the overall quality of a cat photograph. In every case, the function answers a deceptively simple question: is the cat truly, visually *here*?

## Three Qualities

To answer that question faithfully, the function must evaluate three distinct qualities of the image. Each quality captures a different dimension of what it means for a cat to be visually present, and only when all three are satisfied does a photograph achieve the highest score.

### 1. Scale

The first quality is scale — the sheer physical proportion of the frame that the cat occupies. This is the most intuitive dimension of visual presence. A cat that fills a generous share of the image feels important. It feels like the subject. A cat that occupies only a sliver of the frame, no matter how sharp or well-lit, feels like a footnote in someone else's story.

Scale is about visual weight. When a cat is large within the frame, our eyes have nowhere else to go. The fur, the ears, the posture — all of it becomes available for appreciation. When a cat is small, it competes with every other element in the scene: the furniture, the landscape, the negative space. Scale does not demand that the cat fill every pixel, but it does demand that the cat feel like the reason the image exists. A photograph where the cat commands, say, a quarter or more of the visual area carries a fundamentally different energy than one where the cat is a distant speck. The function must be sensitive to this, rewarding images where the cat's size makes it the undeniable anchor of the composition.

### 2. Completeness

The second quality is completeness — whether the cat is wholly contained within the boundaries of the frame. This quality exists in necessary tension with scale. It is easy to make a cat large by zooming in until it overflows the edges, but a cat whose paws are sliced off by the bottom of the frame, whose ears are cropped by the top, or whose tail vanishes beyond the margin does not feel fully present. It feels interrupted. The viewer senses that the subject continues beyond what they can see, and that incompleteness undermines the very presence the scale was trying to achieve.

Completeness asks whether we can see the whole cat — not necessarily every whisker in forensic detail, but the full form of the animal from nose to tail, contained comfortably within the image. A cat that is generously scaled yet fully visible within the frame gives the viewer the satisfying sense of a complete subject. Nothing is missing. Nothing is left to imagination or frustration. The cat is all there, and the frame holds it with care. Conversely, a cat that spills beyond the edges, no matter how large it appears, carries a penalty. It suggests that the framing was too tight, too accidental, or too careless to capture the subject as a whole. The function must treat clipping and cropping as a meaningful flaw — not a catastrophic one, but a real and measurable reduction in visual presence.

### 3. Intentionality

The third quality is intentionality — the sense that the cat's size and placement within the frame feel deliberate rather than accidental. This is the most subtle of the three qualities, but it is what elevates a photograph from technically adequate to genuinely satisfying. A cat can be large and complete yet still feel like it wandered into the frame by coincidence. Intentionality is the quality that separates a photograph *of* a cat from a photograph that merely *contains* a cat.

Intentionality manifests in the relationship between the cat and the space around it. A cat that is well-scaled and comfortably contained, with a natural margin of space that neither crowds nor isolates it, feels like it was placed there on purpose — as if the photographer saw the cat, recognized it as the subject, and framed the shot accordingly. When the cat is awkwardly jammed against one edge, or when it is technically complete but floating in a vast ocean of empty background, the sense of intentionality erodes. The function must reward the sweet spot: a cat that is big enough to command attention, whole enough to be fully appreciated, and situated within the frame in a way that feels composed. This is the quality that captures the difference between a snapshot and a portrait, between something that happened to include a cat and something that was built around one.

## Conclusion

Together, these three qualities — scale, completeness, and intentionality — form a philosophy of visual presence. None of them alone is sufficient. A cat that is enormous but cropped is incomplete. A cat that is whole but tiny is insignificant. A cat that is large and complete but awkwardly placed feels like an accident. Only when all three qualities converge does the photograph achieve what cat-visual-presence is designed to recognize: a cat that is undeniably, generously, and wholly *there*.
